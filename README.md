# The Cube
OS Project 3

## Instructions to run
Compile the game using the make file by running `make`.
Run the game with the command `./cube` and then start in single-step mode with the character **s** or in continuous mode with the character **c**. You can only run continuous mode once, as it will continue until the end of the game. We have noticed that with certain configurations of bash the game can end without the prompt showing up, if this occurs simply hit **enter** and then it should show the prompt.
